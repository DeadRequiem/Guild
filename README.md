# Guild
This is a repository for all things related to and associated with the recreation and implementation of recreating the 'Guild' Features of 1998 game 'Well of Souls'

This will be used as a display, generalized host, and progress tracker for this related goal
This will also server as a way for third-party input on how to better and recreate functionality for a long since dead system.

Where as I can't say this will provide anything useful or will even pan out in the end, it will exist. 
This ReadMe will be changed, modified or updated at my (Demi/DeadRequiem) discression.
